# Reader Doc

This is a sample Python project demonstrating project structure, relative imports, and testing.

## Run the scripts
Run main.py with

```bash
python3 -m reader_doc.main
```

Run __main__.py with
```bash
python3 -m reader_doc
```

Run reader_doc.compressed.bzipped
```bash
python3 -m reader_doc.compressed.bzipped
```

Since bzipped doesn't have relative imports, one can also run
```bash
python3 reader_doc/compressed/bzipped.py
```
